<h1> Data Extraction from Wikipedia using Python, Pandas, and Beautiful Soup</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This README provides an overview of the process of extracting data from the Wikipedia page "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue">List of largest companies in the United States by revenue</a>" using Python, Pandas, and Beautiful Soup.</p>

<h2>Data Extraction Process</h2>

<p>The data extraction process involved the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>URL Retrieval:</strong> The Wikipedia URL "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue">List of largest companies in the United States by revenue</a>" was identified as the source of data.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Python's Beautiful Soup library was utilized to parse the HTML content of the Wikipedia page and extract the relevant data tables.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Pandas library was employed to manipulate the extracted data, including cleaning, filtering, and formatting as necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Knowledge Gained</h2>

<p>Through this project, the following knowledge and skills were acquired:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Understanding of web scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup to extract data from HTML web pages.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Proficiency in using Pandas for data manipulation tasks such as cleaning, filtering, and formatting.</li>
  
  <li><strong>HTML Parsing:</strong> Knowledge of HTML structure and parsing HTML content using Beautiful Soup for data extraction purposes.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Ability to analyze and interpret extracted data to derive insights and make informed decisions.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Experience in documenting the data extraction process and methodology for future reference and sharing with others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, the data extraction from the Wikipedia page using Python, Pandas, and Beautiful Soup provided valuable insights into web scraping techniques and data manipulation skills. The acquired knowledge can be applied to similar data extraction tasks in the future, facilitating efficient data retrieval and analysis.</p>
